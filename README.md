This is a website for "StopFlood", the cheap and effective emergency water shut-off solution. Many homes in North America are simply not prepared for the event of a flood due to a leak. StopFlood provides a simple and affordable solution that uses wireless sensors to quickly detect a water leakage. When the StopFlood system detects a leak, it will automatically shut off the main water supply in the home in 3-5 seconds, which can easily save the owner/resident thousands of dollars.
